## Background

### 3Blue1Brown: Neural Networks

Visual explanations of how neural networks work. If you want to understand what's happening under the hood, start here.

**Full playlist:** [Neural Networks](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&si=I2K50WC6o2SrVLgD)

**Embeddings section** (starts at 12:27): How LLMs store and represent information. This explains why context windows matter and why models struggle with certain tasks.

### AI Jason Z – YouTube

Tutorials on AI coding tools and workflows. Covers new releases, integration patterns, and practical implementation.

### LM Arena Leaderboard

Community-driven rankings of AI models based on blind comparisons. Users vote on responses from anonymous models, creating a live leaderboard. Use this to see which models perform best for different tasks before committing to one.

## Coding Tools

### Claude Code

Command-line interface for Claude. Reads and writes files, runs bash commands, executes git operations. Use this for refactoring, debugging, or building features that need filesystem access.

### LM Studio

Run open-source models locally. No internet required. Install Llama, Mistral, or other models and run them on your hardware. Good for working with sensitive data or experimenting without API costs.

## Platforms

### Smithery

Marketplace for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Install tools to extend Claude with database access, API integrations, or custom capabilities.

### NRP AI

UC Merced provides free access to open-weight models (Llama, Mistral, etc.) through the National Research Platform. Good for research projects with high API volume, fine-tuning experiments, or batch inference. Contact [esilberman@ucmerced.edu](mailto:esilberman@ucmerced.edu) for access.

### n8n

Workflow automation with LLMs. Build pipelines that connect models to databases, schedule AI tasks, or chain multiple models together. I'm hosting an instance for UC Merced students/faculty—email [esilberman@ucmerced.edu](mailto:esilberman@ucmerced.edu) if you want access.
